## Steps to run the app/assignment

**Step 1: Install Flutter and Dart**

Before you can work with Flutter projects, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your computer. Follow the official installation guide for your operating system:

- [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

**Step 2: Set Up a Development Environment**

You'll also need a code editor or IDE for Flutter development. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA. Install one of these and install the Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions for your chosen editor.

**Step 3: Clone the GitHub Repository**

Assuming you have Git installed on your system, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Use the `git clone` command to clone the GitHub repository. Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

**Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change your working directory to the cloned project directory:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

**Step 5: Install Dependencies**

Flutter projects often have dependencies that need to be installed. Run the following command to fetch and install the project's dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**Step 6: Run the Flutter App**

Now you can run the Flutter app using the `flutter run` command. This command will build and start your app:

```bash
flutter run
```

By default, this will run your app on a connected device or emulator. Make sure you have a device or emulator set up.

**Step 7: Test the App**

Once the app is running, you can interact with it on your emulator or connected device. Any changes you make to the code will automatically hot-reload, allowing you to see the results in real-time.

**Optional Step: Customize Configuration**

Depending on the specific repository you're working with, you may need to configure API keys, settings, or other environment-specific variables. Check the project's documentation or README for any specific configuration instructions.

That's it! You should now have the Flutter app from the GitHub repository up and running on your development environment. You can start making changes to the code, test features, and further develop the app as needed.
